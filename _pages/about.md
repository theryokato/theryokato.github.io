Howdy! I am a second-year Mechanical Engineering student at Texas A&M University. I am completing my Bachelor of Science while conducting undergraduate research at the [Controls and Robotics Lab](https://zh.engr.tamu.edu/) under Dr. Minghui Zheng. Proficient in Python, Embedded C++, SolidWorks, and System Design. My passion lies in control systems, mobile space robotics, and mechanical design.

I am an officer under [TURTLE Robotics](https://www.turtlerobotics.org/), having worked on a prosthetic hand, an autonomous drone swarm, and a self-balancing robot. I am also member of [TAMU Rocket Engine Design](https://www.tamured.space/), where we are building Texas A&M's most powerful rocket engine in history.
