I am a second year Mechanical Engineering student at Texas A&M University. I am completing my Bachelor of Science while conducting undergraduate research at the [Controls and Robotics Lab](https://zh.engr.tamu.edu/) under Dr. Minghui Zheng. My passion lies in control systems, mobile space robotics, and mechanical design. I am actively pursuing hands-on projects to further expand and refine my technical skillset.
