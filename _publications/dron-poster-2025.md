The Disaster Response Observation Network (DRON) is a proof-of-concept initiative that aims to leverage unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to gather intelligence during structural fires to aide first responders in their scene assessment and emergency vehicles.

Autonomous swarm functionality allows DRON to assist in emergency situations with minimal required human input. DRON is designed around ease of use, speed of deployment, and quality of data gathered and presented.

<ins>Functional Requirements</ins>
- A network where each individual node can function independently of each other for redundancy.
- Data transmitted to a centralized Ground Control Station (GCS) for interpretation and use by responders without a technical background.
- Ability to display hotspots on interactive 3D structures to model surrounding hazardous areas.
- Ability to carry payload of instrumentation (~500g) while maintaining flight at ~100 ft long enough to appropriately gather critical data.
