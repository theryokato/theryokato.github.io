BLNC is a project at [TURTLE Robotics](https://www.turtlerobotics.org/projects/blnc), a student-led undergraduate robotics organization. BLNC is focusing on developing rovers that can adjust the location of their center of gravity to maintain stability in extreme terrains. These rovers follow a two-wheeled inverted pendulum architecture. As project member, I implemented a cascade PID control system in Python with Neo motors and Moteus motor controllers, enabling pitch and position control
