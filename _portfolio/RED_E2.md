Elysium 2 is a project at [TAMU Rocket Engine Design](https://www.tamured.space/projects/elysium-2), a student-led undergraduate rocketry organization. The project aims to develop the next Texas A&M's most powerful rocket engine with built-in throttling and gimbaling capabilities. I have designed a steel flame diverter capable of redirecting a 1800 K exhaust plume for 15+ seconds and conducted a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), safeguarding critical test infrastructure and the surrounding environment. I have also conducted detailed component analysis for electronics, wires, and sensors to confirm compatibility and prevent integration issues, minimizing project delays and resource waste
