DRON is a project at [TURTLE Robotics](https://www.turtlerobotics.org/projects/dron), a student-led undergraduate robotics organization. The Disaster Response Observation Network (DRON) is a proof-of-concept initiative that aims to leverage unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to gather intelligence during structural fires to aide first responders in their scene assessment and emergency response. As the mechanical systems lead, I implemented an iterative 3D printing prototyping process to rapidly incorporate learned improvements, resulting in a collaborative agile design cycle. Multiple iterations of the mechanical design was created, improving modularity and durability in each cycle.
